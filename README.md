## Overview
This is a Spring Boot application that follows a layered architecture using standard Java design patterns. It demonstrates how to:
- Build RESTful APIs using Spring MVC
- Persist data using Spring Data JPA
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to decouple the entity layer from the controller
- Apply clean separation of concerns through Controller, Service, Repository, and Entity layers

## Project Structure

```
com.technicaldc.demo
1.  DemoApplication.java         → Entry point of the Spring Boot application
2.  controller/                  → Exposes REST APIs
    2.1  UserController.java
3.  service/                     → Business logic layer
    3.1  UserService.java
    3.2  Message.java            → Utility or response wrapper
4.  repository/                  → Interfaces for DB interaction
    4.1  UserRepository.java
5.  entity/                      → JPA-annotated persistence models
    5.1  UserEntity.java
6.  dto/                         → Objects for data transfer
    6.1  UserDto.java
```

## Key Concepts & Definitions

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a Java framework that simplifies building production-ready Spring applications by minimizing boilerplate code and configuration.

### REST Controller
Marked with `@RestController`, these components expose HTTP endpoints (GET, POST, etc.) to handle client requests.

### Service Layer
Contains business logic, ensuring that controllers are thin and only manage request/response handling.

### Repository Layer
Interfaces extending `JpaRepository` to allow automatic implementation of common CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA.

### Entity
A POJO annotated with `@Entity` representing a table in the database.

### DTO (Data Transfer Object)
An object used to transfer data between different layers or systems. It helps decouple internal data models from what is exposed externally.

## Layer-by-Layer Breakdown

### 1. `DemoApplication.java`
- This is the **main class** with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.
- It boots up the Spring context and starts the embedded server (e.g., Tomcat).

### 2. Controller Layer – `UserController.java`
- Annotated with `@RestController`
- Exposes REST endpoints like `/users`
- Accepts HTTP requests, validates input (possibly), and calls service methods
- Sends responses wrapped in objects like `ResponseEntity` or a custom `Message`

### 3. Service Layer – `UserService.java`
- Marked with `@Service`
- Handles application logic such as user creation, retrieval, or validation
- Talks to the `UserRepository` to fetch/store data
- Converts between `UserDto` and `UserEntity` as needed

### 4. Repository Layer – `UserRepository.java`
- Annotated with `@Repository` or inherited from `JpaRepository`
- Abstracts the database layer with automatic implementation of queries like `findAll()`, `save()`, `deleteById()`

### 5. Entity – `UserEntity.java`
- Annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table`
- Maps fields to columns using `@Column`
- May use annotations like `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue` for primary keys
- Represents how data is stored in the database

### 6. DTO – `UserDto.java`
- Used in requests/responses instead of exposing `UserEntity`
- Lightweight, serialization-friendly, and good for API versioning

### 7. Utility – `Message.java`
- Likely a wrapper for uniform API responses like:
```json
{
    "message": "Operation successful",
        "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

## Configuration & Build Tools

### `pom.xml`
This Maven file includes:
- `spring-boot-starter-web` → Web support
- `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` → JPA integration
- `lombok` → Boilerplate reduction (getters/setters, constructors)
- `h2` or `mysql-connector-java` → In-memory or MySQL DB support

### `application.properties` or `application.yaml`
Contains key configurations like:
```properties
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

## Testing
- Basic test class `DemoApplicationTests` exists in the test folder
